This webpage displays, in table form, the estimated number of donuts that will need to be made per store location per hour. It also displays the estimated total per day for each location.These estimates are calculated based on the following data:

-minimum and maximum number of customers per hour for each location

-average number of donuts purchased per customer

For each hour of the day, the algorithm selects, uniformly at random, the number of customers per hour within the specified range. This is multiplied by the average number purchased per customer.

There is also a submission form for adding new store locations.
